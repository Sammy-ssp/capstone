## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This challenge was provided by Arvato Financial Solutions for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. There were two major steps in the project and the submission

1. Customer Segmentation Report
Using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model
Accessing attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. You'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
Making predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. Ranking the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer.
