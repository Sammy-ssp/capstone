## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, I took a closer look at Airbnbâ€™s two data sets from Seattle and Boston to inspect travelers behavior and the most crucial aspects of being a host. The aim with this goal is to get insights about the Airbnb datasets following the CRISP-DM methodology.

In order to start working with the data, it is crucial to formulate real-world questions beforehand that will be answered soon. Since we are living in a very fast-pacing world and environment, one of the most interesting question for me is what exactly are the criteria that influence travelers from around the world to ultimately book a trip to the big wide world? 
More precise:
- What impact does timing have on lodging prices?
- Is it really positive to be ranked as a superhost on Airbnb?
- What differences can be identified between the two cities of Seattle and Boston?

I will do the following steps based on the CRISP-DM methodology:

1. Datset will be [Boston AirBNB data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle AirBNB data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)
2. Formulate questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
5. Prepare data
6. Modeling
7. Evaluation
8. Communicate your business insights
